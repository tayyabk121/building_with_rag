# Master prompt — Update curl manual tests for one story

Paste this prompt into your coding assistant from the capstone repository. Replace `<STORY_NUMBER>` with the implemented story number, for example `1.1`, `1.4`, `2.2`, or `3.4`.

---

The implemented story is **Story `<STORY_NUMBER>`**. Update `docs/manual-tests.md` with a short manual-test section for this story. Change only `docs/manual-tests.md`; do not implement or change product code, configuration, tests, data, or story files.

First read the implemented story in `docs/stories/`, its actual routes and request/response models, and the current `docs/manual-tests.md`. If no story exactly matches `<STORY_NUMBER>`, stop and report that. Use the current code as the authority; do not invent endpoints, payload fields, model IDs, response fields, or expected behavior.

Create or replace only the section headed `## Story <STORY_NUMBER> — ...`. Preserve every other story section. Keep this section short:

1. One sentence: **What it adds**.
2. One short prerequisite note only when needed, such as starting the API or setting a named `.env` variable. Never include a secret value.
3. A code block containing only the curl commands needed to prove the story works. Every API curl command must use the real method, URL, headers, JSON payload, and contract fields. Use `http://127.0.0.1:8000` unless the implemented code documents another local address.
4. One brief expected-result line after each command or command group. State the important status/result field, selected pattern/model, and the expected answer, source, error, no-match, clarification, or draft behavior.

For a story with an HTTP endpoint, include:

- one successful curl command;
- one relevant failure, empty-result, or edge-case curl command;
- a curl command for each new selectable RAG mode it adds.

For a chat or streaming story, include a real OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` curl request. Use `"stream": true` when streaming is implemented and state that the response ends with `data: [DONE]`. Do not document Open WebUI steps.

For an ingestion, MongoDB, or index story with no HTTP endpoint, include only its real existing CLI command(s), not invented curl commands. Do not add a Postman, Open WebUI, automated-test, database-inspection, or production-readiness checklist.

After editing, ensure the story appears exactly once, every code fence is closed, and each command refers to a real implemented route or module. Report the section heading you updated.
